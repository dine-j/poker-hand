# Poker hand

Front-end technical test in Javascript.

## Task

A poker hand has a constructor that accepts a string containing 5 cards: 

```
var hand = new PokerHand("KS 2H 5C JD TD");
```

and a method to compare itself to another hand

```
PokerHand.prototype.compareWith = function(hand) { /* Your code here */ };
```

The characteristics of the string of cards are:
* A space is used as card separator
* Each card consists of two characters
* The first character is the value of the card, valid characters are: `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `T`(en), `J`(ack), `Q`(ueen), `K`(ing), `A`(ce)
* The second character represents the suit, valid characters are: `S`(pades), `H`(earts), `D`(iamonds), `C`(lubs)

The result of your poker hand compare can be one of these 3 options:
* Win should return the integer `1`
* Loss should return the integer `2`
* Tie should return the integer `3`

The ranking of the hands should follow the [Texas Hold'em rules](http://freepokerhoney.com/website_images/8245/poker-strategy/poker-hand-rankings.png)
